The aim of the summer internship was to expand on the project of measurement of vital signs using Microwave Radar, under supervision of Prof. Constantinos Pitris. During the project, my responsibility was to develop a digital signal processing algorithm, in MATLAB, which would be able to extract patientâ€™s heart rate and breathing rate given Doppler Radar Signals. Simultaneously, ECG recordings were being obtained from patient and analysed by the algorithm to obtain reference heart rate and breathing rate samples. Algorithm involved many processing techniques, for instance digital filtering, Fast Fourier Transform, Welch, Burg, Yule-Walker, and Lomb-Scargle PSD estimation methods.
